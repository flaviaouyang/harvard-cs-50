## The Internet

- Internet is **the network of networks** of computers communicating with one another.
-  **Routers** are <u>specialized computers with CPUs and memory</u>, whose purpose is to relay data cross cables or wireless technologies, between other devices on the internet.
- **Protocols** are <u>a set of standard conventions</u> that the world has agreed upon for computers to communicate with.
- **TCP/IP** are two protocols for sending data between two computers.
	- consider sending mail, one would put return address and recipient address on the envelope 
	- This envelope in computer science will be referred to as **packets** of information.
- **IP** stands for <u>internet protocol</u>, a protocol supported by modern computer's software which includes a standard way for computers to address each other.
	- **IP address** is unique address for computer connected to the internet.
	- In routers' memory, there is a table mapping IP addresses to cables each connected to other routers.
- **DNS** stands for <u>Domain Name System</u> which is another technology that translate domain names to IP addresses.
	- DNS is generally provided as a service by the nearest internet service provider or **ISP**.
- **TCP** stands for <u>Transmission Control Protocol</u>. 
	- TCP is one final protocol that allows a single server, at the same IP address, to provide multiple services through the use of **a port number**, a small integer added to the IP address.
