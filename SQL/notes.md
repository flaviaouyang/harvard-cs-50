##  Data Processing

- **Database** is a file or programs that stores data for us.
- A CSV file is a **flat-file database** where the data for each column is separate by commas 

## Relational databases

- **Relational databases** are programs that store data, ultimately in files, but with additional data structures and interfaces that allow us to search and store data more efficiently.

## SQL

- **Structured Query Language** 
- **CRUD**
	- `CREATE`
	- `READ`
	- `UPDATE`
	- `DELETE`
- SQL:
	- `CREATE`, `INSERT`
	- `SELECT`
	- `UPDATE`
	- `DELETE`
- Create a table: `CREATE TABLE table (column type, ...)`;
- Getting data: `SELECT columns FROM table;  `
