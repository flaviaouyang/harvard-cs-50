# Data Structure 

- *Data strucuture* are more complex ways to organize data in memory, allowing us to store information in different layouts.

## Linked Lists

- With linked list, we can store a list of values that can easily be grown by storing values in different parts of memory:

```c
typedef struct
{
	string name;
  int number;
}
node;
```
